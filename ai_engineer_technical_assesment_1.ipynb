    "## Overview\n",
    "Build an AI-powered solution for sentiment analysis of movie reviews that leverages the existing dataset to improve accuracy. This assessment is designed to be completed in 2-3 hours, we do NOT expect very detailed answers or long explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- AI assistance is allowed and, in fact, encouraged. caveats are:\n",
    "    - Concise explanations and simple code are preferred\n",
    "    - Solutions that use newer information and go beyond LLMs cuttof date are valuable.\n",
    "    - You must be able to explain the code you write here\n",
    "\n",
    "- Look up any information you need, copy and paste code is allowed.\n",
    "- Setup the environment as needed. You can use your local environment, colab, or any other environment of your preferenc.\n",
    "- Focus on working solutions, leave iteration and improvements if you have extra time.\n",
